## Notes on using this specified eslint configurations

AirBnB;s styling brings about neatness, simplicity and gives a very fast option when a developer is focusing on code logic than looking out for why a syntaxing rule is not current.
I used it specifically and avoided using es-lint extension due to my recent health conditions and focused more using a very simple extension.
